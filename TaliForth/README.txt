This is the README.txt version released with Tali Forth BETA 001. Note that this is a BETA release of an incomplete program. See the .ods spreadsheet for a list of supported instructions, or type WORDS once Tali Forth is running. Tali Forth is hosted at GitHub, you can find the most current version at

INTRODUCTION

Tali Forth is a Subroutine Threaded Code (STC) implementation for the 65c02 closely modeled on the ANS Forth standard. I wrote it because I wanted to understand the inner workings of Forth and have a modern implementation of the language for my 65c02 single board computer, the Ãœbersquirrel (see http://uebersquirrel.blogspot.de/). It is released in the public domain with no warranty of any kind -- use at your own risk. See COPYING.txt for details.

Tali Forth aims to be, in rough order of priority: 

- Simple. The primary aim is to understand a complete Forth system byte by byte.
  This is why the STC format was chosen, and why the dictionary has a rather
  strange structure (see dictionary.txt for details). This is also the reason
  the source code is perversely over-commented. 

- Specific. Many Forths available are "general" implementations with a small
  core adapted to the target processor. Tali Forth was written for the 65c02
  8-bit MPU and that MPU only, with its strengths and limitations in mind.

- Standardized. Most Forths available for the 6502/65c02 are based on old 
  standards, for example FIG Forth. Learning Forth with them is like trying to
  learn modern English with Chaucer. Tali Forth follows the ANS Draft Standard
  200x, in the hope that it will soon be the current standard.  
  
- Speedy. Tali Forth places speed over size (within reason). The aim is to keep
  it and the kernel routines in 8k of ROM for single board computers. A further
  8k could be used for a library of Forth routines.



IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (BETA 001)

A lot of words have barely been tested. Most are unoptimized.

Tali Forth uses subroutine threading for longer words but automatically compiles shorter routines in native 65c02 code. In the current version, the decision which words are compiled how is on an ad-hoc basis; in future, this will follow a rule based on speed and size of the routine. 

As a very simple implementation, Tali Forth does not support multitasking and is not thread safe in any sense of the word. There are no individual USER variables. Interrupts are currently not implemented in the kernel or Forth code. 

The "functional" reference is gforth (http://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/). Code that works on Tali Forth should produce the same result in gForth or have a good reason why it is different. 


ASSEMBLY AND TESTING

Tali Forth was written with vim and the Ophis 2.1 cross-assembler (http://michaelcmartin.github.io/Ophis/). Ophis uses a slightly different format than other assemblers, but is in Python and therefore will run on almost any operating system. To install Ophis on Windows, use the link provided above. For Linux: 

        git clone https://github.com/michaelcmartin/Ophis
        cd src
        sudo python setup.py install

Switch to the folder where the Tali code lives, and assemble with

        ophis --65c02 Tali-main-B001.asm 


Development was performed with py65mon (https://github.com/mnaberez/py65) which is also in Python. To install on Linux:

        sudo pip install -U py65

(If you don't have PIP installed, you will have to add it first with something like 

        sudo apt-get install python-pip

There is a setup.py script as part of the package, too.) To start the emulator, run:

        py65mon --mpu 65C02 -r ophis.bin


Note that for testing and development, Tali Forth compiles to 16k and is installed starting $C000 instead of $E000. This is because py65mon hardcodes the input and output routines at the beginning of $F000 and I'm too lazy to modify them (at the moment). 



NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS 

Any feedback and comments are welcome. Feel free to adapt Tali Forth to your own system. Please note: 

- The X register should not be changed without saving its pointer status

- The Y register is free to be changed by subroutines. This means it should not
  be expected to survive subroutines unchanged.



WHY "TALI" FORTH?

I like the name, and we're probably not going to have anymore kids I can give it to. 

(If it sounds vaguely familiar, you're probably thinking of Tali'Zorah vas Normandy, a character in the "Mass Effect" universe created by EA / BioWare. This software has absolutely nothing to do with either the game or the companies and neither do I, expect that I've played the games and enjoyed them.)

TODO for Tali Forth for the 65c02 Project
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
This version: 10. Feb 2015

As of Feb 10, 2015 Tali Forth is in BETA status. This means the code has entered a "feature freeze" (ie no new words) with the aim of finding bugs and opitimizing the code. Optimization areas include: 

- simplify high-level word definitions
- see if we can do without the various "(..)" helper functions of words
- check code for use of BIT 
- unroll macros for better readability of text
- consider subroutine to compile JSR/JMP with stuff from stack

Apart from that, we should look into a formal testing suit for Forth.


=== SUGGESTIONS FOR ADDITIONAL FEATURES === 

These will be considered once Tali Forth has reached its first full release, not before

- add CASE, TIME&DATE, THROW/CATCH
- warn when we redefine a word already in the dictionary

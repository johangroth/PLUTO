TODO for Tali Forth for the 65c02 Project
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
This version: 29. Dec 2016

As of Feb 10, 2015 Tali Forth is in BETA status. This means the code has entered a "feature freeze" (ie no new words) with the aim of finding bugs and opitimizing the code. Optimization areas include: 

- simplify high-level word definitions
- see if we can do without the various "(..)" helper functions of words
- check code for use of BIT 
- unroll macros for better readability of text
- consider subroutine to compile JSR/JMP with stuff from stack

Apart from that, we should look into a formal testing suit for Forth.


=== MAJOR REWRITE === 

There will probably be a major rewrite of Tali Forth in the future, since I've learned so much more by now. Possible changes:

- Keeping header and code parts of the dictionary separate, to get rid of the BRA instruction at the beginning of every entry and to be able to have the words reuse code
- Use a pre-built board from WDC as a reference design
- Consider multitasking

There is no date for a rewrite except for "after Liara Forth is done" (https://github.com/scotws/LiaraForth)


=== SUGGESTIONS FOR ADDITIONAL FEATURES === 

These will be considered once Tali Forth has reached its first full release, not before

- add CASE, TIME&DATE, THROW/CATCH
- warn when we redefine a word already in the dictionary

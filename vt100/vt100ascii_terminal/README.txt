To compile an update version of the firmware make the project "Terminal" the main project.  Then recompile it.  The
resultant hex file is called:
  Source\Terminal\Terminal\dist\default\production\Terminal.production.hex


Updates must be loaded with the standard Microchip bootloader.  This and instructions are in the PC App folder.

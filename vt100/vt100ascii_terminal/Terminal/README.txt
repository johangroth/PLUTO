VT100 Terminal
Geoff Graham,  April 2014

Requires MPLAB X and the XC32 compiler to build.  Both are
free and can be downloaded from microchip.com
This was built correctly by MPLAB X V1.51 and XC32 V1.30.

If you are building the firmware and using the ICSP socket to
program the chip you should make sure that the linker script
32MX250F128B.ld is NOT included in the MPLAB X project file.

If you are building the firmware to be loaded via the bootloader
then you MUST make sure that the linker script 32MX250F128B.ld
IS included in the MPLAB X project file.

Note that this source does not include the bootloader.
